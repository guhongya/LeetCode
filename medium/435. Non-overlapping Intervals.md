## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals
### [题目](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
#### 注意
1. You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
2. Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
#### 例子

```
Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.

Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

```

    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(Interval[] intervals) {
        List<Interval> tem = Arrays.asList(intervals);
        Collections.sort(tem, new Comparator<Interval>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(Interval o1, Interval o2) {
                return o1.end - o2.end;
            }
        });
        int end = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int result = 0;
        for (Interval a : tem) {
            if (end <= a.start) {
                end = a.end;
            } else {
                result++;
            }

        }
        return result;
    }
}
